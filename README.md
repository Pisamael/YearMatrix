YearMatrixYearMatrix is a minimalist Android application and Live Wallpaper Service designed to provide a visual representation of time through a data-driven interface. Built with Kotlin and the Android Canvas API, it transforms the standard home screen into a functional dashboard that tracks your progress through the day, week, and year.🚀 Key Features365-Dot Matrix: A visual grid where each dot represents one day of the year. The grid fills dynamically based on the current date, with built-in logic to handle leap years.24-Hour Progress Bar: A vertical loading bar on the left that tracks the current day in minutes ($1440$ minutes per day), updating every 60 seconds for precision.7-Day Week Progress Bar: A vertical bar on the right that indicates the current day of the week, from Sunday to Saturday.Live Wallpaper Engine: A dedicated WallpaperService that renders the UI directly onto your background, optimized for low battery consumption and high efficiency.Deep Personalization:Custom Backgrounds: Set your own image from the gallery as the backdrop for the matrix.Dot Color Picker: Choose from a variety of colors to match your home screen aesthetic.UI Alignment: Adjust the matrix positioning (Left, Center, Right or Top, Center, Bottom) to fit around your icons.🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: KotlinGraphics: Android Canvas & Custom View drawing (using RectF, Paint, and Path).Architecture: WallpaperService with a SurfaceHolder for persistent background rendering.Persistence: SharedPreferences to ensure your color and alignment preferences persist after reboot.Time API: Extensive use of java.util.Calendar for precise time-to-coordinate mapping.📊 Data Visualization LogicAs a project developed by a CSE Data Science student, YearMatrix focuses on accurate data mapping:Normalization: All time values are converted to normalized floats ($0.0$ to $1.0$) to ensure smooth rendering across different screen resolutions.$$Progress_{Day} = \frac{(CurrentHour \times 60) + CurrentMinute}{1440}$$Efficient Rendering: The wallpaper engine utilizes a Handler loop that refreshes only when necessary, minimizing CPU cycles and preserving battery life.Coordinate Calculation: The 19x19 dot grid is calculated dynamically based on screen dimensions to maintain a perfect aspect ratio regardless of device orientation.📦 Getting StartedClone this repository to your local machine.Open the project in Android Studio.Build and Run the app on your Android device.Set Wallpaper: Long-press your home screen > Wallpapers > Live Wallpapers > select YearMatrix.🎓 Academic ContextThis project was developed as part of a professional portfolio focused on engineering and data-driven application development.Developer: [Your Name]Institution: Aarupadai Veedu Institute of Technology (AVIT)Major: B.E. in CSE Data Science
